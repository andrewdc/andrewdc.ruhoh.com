# Hidden Rebel Base

_Not to be confused with my antiquated HRB Sass file_

## TL;DR

Overdue personal website overhaul is overdue. 

## I grow tired of asking, so it will be the last time...

Like a lot of people, I simply don't make time to work on my personal site. Part of the problem is that I really want to focus on the content and design, and not mucking around trying to hammer a square Wordpress (I used WP for my former site) into a round hole. 

Part of the problem with Wordpress is that it is an excellend blog platform - but as soon as you try to fit it into something else, it simply requires too much wrangling for my taste.

Thus: [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com) shall be considered.

## Have a bad feeling about this?

Part of the fun of this is exploring what can be done with this framework. That means a certain tolerance for anomalies should be expected.
