            <h4>Just who are we dealing with here?</h4>
            <div class="me"></div>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Andrew Colclough. Professionally I am a designer and front-end UI/UX developer. On the side I enjoy doing game artwork and UI design with some of my developer friends.</p> 
            <p>I love my work because to me it's the creative equivallent of Legos for adults. </p>

            <p>As you've likely guessed, I'm a total nerd at heart, so Internet software is the perfect niche for me. I love to code, I love to draw, and I love to create experiences which are as beautiful, as they are useful.</p>
            
            <p>
             Personally, I love my wife and my family, grace, <a href="http://bastiat.org/" target="_blank">economics, liberty</a>, football (especially the Oregon Ducks), video games, and have a special appreciation for <a href="http://www.blind-guardian.com/" target="_blank">"epic power-metal"</a>.     
            </p>
            
            <h4>Skills and Experience</h4>
            <p>
                I have been working as a designer and front-end developer since 2005. Take a look at my <a class="res" href="#" onclick="return false;">resume</a> to learn about my work experience. While there isn't an aspect of web technology that doesn't interest me, my key strengths are in graphic creation and front-end UI/UX interraction development.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as tools goes, I'm all about Photoshop, CSS, Compass Framework, SCSS, HTML, HAML, Jquery, a bit of Ruby, and a whole legion of rapid prototyping tools. Additionally, I like to bust out pen and paper and some copic markers to quickly throw down ideas.

            <h4>About This Site</h4>
            <p>
                This site has two themes because I wanted to create a unique experience for two different audiences. The Ledgend represents my character and my love for game UI, and art creation - while Blue Steel is an study in modern web application less-is-more UI/UX beauty. 
            </p>
            <p>If you're curious, here is what my previous site design looked like:</p>
