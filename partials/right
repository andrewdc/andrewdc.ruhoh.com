            <h4>Just who are we dealing with here?</h4>
            <div class="me"></div>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Andrew Colclough. Professionally I am a designer and front-end UI/UX developer. On the side I enjoy doing game artwork and UI design with some of my developer friends.</p> 
            <p>I love my work because to me it's the creative equivallent of Legos for adults. </p>

            <p>As you've likely guessed, I'm a total nerd at heart, so Internet software is the perfect niche for me. I love to code, I love to draw, and I love to create experiences which are as beautiful, as they are useful.</p>
            
            <p>
             On the personal side, I love my wife and my family, grace, economics, liberty, <a href="http://goducks.com" target="_blank">football</a>, video games, and have a special appreciation for "<a href="http://www.blind-guardian.com/" target="_blank">epic power-metal</a>."     
            </p>
            
            <h4>Skills and Experience</h4>
            <p>
                I have been working as a designer and front-end developer since 2005. Take a look at my <a class="res" href="#" onclick="return false;">resume</a> to learn about my work experience. While there isn't an aspect of web technology that doesn't interest me, my key strengths are in graphic creation and front-end UI/UX interraction development.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as tools goes, I'm all about Photoshop, CSS, Compass Framework, SCSS, HTML, HAML, Jquery, a bit of Ruby, and a whole legion of rapid prototyping tools. Additionally, I like to bust out pen and paper and some copic markers to quickly throw down ideas.
            </p>

            <h4>About This Site</h4>
            <p>
                I created this site to be fun and interesting to look at, and the design is obviously inspired by game UI. Feel free to poke around and get a feel for my design work. I have some exciting plans moving forward, so what you see here is really just the begining. I hope you enjoy it!<!--If this is too much for you - feel free to try out the <a class="switchy" href="#" onclick="return false;">LessIsMore</a> version. I don't mind. -->
            </p>
            <p>If you're curious, here is what my previous site design looked like:</p>
